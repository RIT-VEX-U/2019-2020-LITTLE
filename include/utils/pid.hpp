/**
 * Creates a PID type object.
 *
 * A PID loop is a closed feedback loop where a "setpoint" is set by the user, and the PID calculates
 * a value sent to the motor that will try and reach that setpoint as fast as possible, without overshooting.
 *
 * The equation is:
 * Kout = kP*error + kI*integral(error) + kD*derivative(error)
 *
 * error = setpoint - current_sensor_val
 * kP, kI, kD are constants that are found through tuning.
 *
 * When tuning PID loops, start with tuning P, proportional. Using Kout = kP * error, or kP = Kout/error, you can
 * figure out a starting point for kP. For example, if you want the output to be .7 when the error is 2, then kP will
 * be .7/2 = .35.
 *
 * If the position never reaches the setpoint, increase kP. If it overshoots and oscillates, lower kP.
 *
 * If the position is accelerating too fast, add D. In general, the starting point for kD is 10 to 100 times kP.
 * If the position
